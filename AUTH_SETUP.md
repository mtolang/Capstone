# Authentication Setup Documentation

This project now includes a complete Firebase Authentication system. Here's what has been implemented:

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. `lib/helper/auth.dart` - Main Authentication Service
This file contains the `AuthService` class with the following methods:
- `signInWithEmailAndPassword()` - Login with email/password
- `registerWithEmailAndPassword()` - Register new users
- `signOut()` - Logout user
- `resetPassword()` - Send password reset email
- `getUserData()` - Get user profile from Firestore
- `updateUserData()` - Update user profile
- `deleteAccount()` - Delete user account
- Email and password validation methods

### 2. `lib/screens/auth/login_page.dart` - Updated Login Page
- Now fully functional with Firebase Auth
- Form validation
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Password visibility toggle
- Forgot password functionality

### 3. `lib/controller/register_controller.dart` - Registration Controllers
- Updated all registration controllers to use Firebase Auth
- Validation for all user types (Parent, Therapist, Clinic)
- Error handling and success dialogs

### 4. `lib/widgets/auth_wrapper.dart` - Authentication State Wrapper
- Listens to authentication state changes
- Automatically redirects users based on login status

### 5. `lib/screens/auth/auth_test_page.dart` - Test Page
- Simple test interface for authentication functions
- Can be accessed via `/authtest` route

### 6. `pubspec.yaml` - Dependencies
- Added `firebase_auth: ^6.0.0`

## How to Use

### Login Process
1. User enters email and password on the login page
2. Validation checks are performed
3. Firebase Auth attempts login
4. On success, user is redirected to `/clinicprofile`
5. On error, appropriate error message is shown

### Registration Process
1. User fills registration form
2. Input validation is performed
3. Firebase Auth creates new user account
4. Additional user data is stored in Firestore
5. Success dialog appears with option to login

### Authentication State Management
The app uses a StreamBuilder to listen to authentication state changes:
```dart
StreamBuilder<User?>(
  stream: AuthService.authStateChanges,
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    // Handle authentication state
  },
)
```

### Error Handling
All authentication methods include comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages for common Firebase Auth exceptions.

## Testing the Authentication

1. **Run the app**: `flutter run`
2. **Navigate to test page**: Go to `/authtest` route
3. **Test registration**: Create a new account
4. **Test login**: Login with the created account
5. **Test logout**: Use the logout button

## Firebase Setup Required

Make sure your Firebase project has:
1. Authentication enabled
2. Email/Password provider enabled
3. Firestore database created
4. Proper security rules for Firestore

## User Data Structure in Firestore

User documents are stored in the `users` collection with this structure:
```javascript
{
  uid: "user_id",
  email: "user@example.com",
  fullName: "User Name",
  clinicName: "Clinic Name" (for clinic users),
  phoneNumber: "Phone Number",
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}
```

## Security Features

- Password validation (minimum 6 characters)
- Email format validation
- Input sanitization
- Secure password storage (handled by Firebase)
- User session management

## Next Steps

1. Update other login pages (parent_login.dart, therapist_login.dart) to use the AuthService
2. Implement role-based navigation based on user type
3. Add email verification for new accounts
4. Implement user profile management screens
5. Add more comprehensive error handling and user feedback
