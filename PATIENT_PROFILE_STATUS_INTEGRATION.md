# Patient Profile Dynamic Status Integration

## Overview
The Patient Profile's Schedule tab now uses the same intelligent status system as the Patient List, providing consistent status indicators across the entire clinic management system.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Status Calculation
**Added Method**: `_calculateDynamicStatus(Map<String, dynamic> booking)`
- **Same Logic**: Identical to patient list status calculation
- **Weekly Schedule Aware**: Based on day-of-week contract logic
- **OT Assessment Integration**: Checks OTAssessments database for completion
- **Fallback Matching**: Primary by `childName`, fallback by `patientId`

### 2. Enhanced Schedule Cards
**Updated**: `_buildSimpleScheduleCard(Map<String, dynamic> booking)`
- **Replaced**: Static status display with dynamic FutureBuilder
- **Real-time Updates**: Status changes automatically based on schedule and assessments
- **Loading States**: Shows progress indicator while calculating
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to "Active" if calculation fails

### 3. Statistics Transformation
**Changed**: "Total" statistic to show OT Assessments count
- **Before**: Total showed schedule count
- **After**: "Assessments" shows actual OT assessments completed
- **Dynamic Counts**: Upcoming and Completed use intelligent status calculation
- **Real-time Updates**: Statistics update as assessments are added

### 4. Consistent Status Types
**Schedule Tab Status Options**:
- ðŸŸ  **Upcoming**: Appointment day hasn't arrived this week
- ðŸŸ  **Today**: Appointment scheduled for today
- ðŸŸ¢ **In Session**: Currently during appointment time
- ðŸŸ¢ **Active**: Past appointment day, no assessment yet
- ðŸ”´ **Needs Assessment**: Session ended, assessment pending
- ðŸ”µ **Completed**: OT assessment completed

## Technical Implementation

### Status Calculation Flow
```dart
Future<Map<String, dynamic>> _calculateDynamicStatus(booking) async {
  // 1. Extract contract schedule (dayOfWeek, appointmentTime)
  // 2. Check OT Assessment by childName + clinicId
  // 3. Apply weekly schedule logic (Mon-Sun)
  // 4. Return status with color and text
}
```

### Enhanced Statistics
```dart
// OT Assessments count (replaces "Total")
StreamBuilder<QuerySnapshot>(
  stream: FirebaseFirestore.instance
    .collection('OTAssessments')
    .where('childName', isEqualTo: patientName)
    .snapshots(),
  builder: (context, snapshot) => _buildRecordStat(
    'Assessments', 
    snapshot.data?.docs.length.toString() ?? '0'
  ),
),

// Dynamic upcoming/completed counts
FutureBuilder<int>(
  future: _getUpcomingCountDynamic(schedules),
  builder: (context, snapshot) => _buildRecordStat(
    'Upcoming', 
    snapshot.data?.toString() ?? '...'
  ),
),
```

### Visual Status Indicators
```dart
FutureBuilder<Map<String, dynamic>>(
  future: _calculateDynamicStatus(booking),
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    final statusColor = snapshot.data?['statusColor'] ?? defaultColor;
    final statusText = snapshot.data?['statusText'] ?? 'Active';
    
    return Container(
      decoration: BoxDecoration(color: statusColor),
      child: Text(statusText),
    );
  },
),
```

## Database Integration

### OT Assessments Query
```javascript
// Primary matching (most reliable)
{
  childName: "Taylor",
  clinicId: "CLI01"
}

// Fallback matching (if name fails)
{
  patientId: "parentId_from_profile",
  clinicId: "CLI01"
}
```

### Contract Schedule Extraction
```javascript
// From booking data
{
  contractInfo: {
    dayOfWeek: "Friday",
    appointmentTime: "14:00 - 15:00"
  }
}

// Or from originalRequestData
{
  originalRequestData: {
    contractInfo: {
      dayOfWeek: "Friday",
      appointmentTime: "14:00 - 15:00"
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits for Your Use Case

### Problem Solved
- **Consistent Status Display**: Patient profile now matches patient list status logic
- **Assessment Tracking**: "Assessments" count shows actual OT completions instead of schedule count
- **Real-time Accuracy**: Status updates automatically as time progresses and assessments are completed

### User Experience
- **Visual Consistency**: Same color coding and terminology across all screens
- **Meaningful Statistics**: "Assessments" count provides actual therapy completion tracking
- **Weekly Schedule Clarity**: Status reflects weekly contract schedule correctly

### Example - Today (Wednesday, Oct 23) with Friday Appointments
**Patient Profile Schedule Tab**:
- **Assessments**: 1 (from OTAssessments database)
- **Upcoming**: Shows patients with Friday appointments as "Upcoming"
- **Completed**: Shows patients with completed assessments as "Completed"
- **Schedule Cards**: Individual cards show dynamic status based on day-of-week logic

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Additions
- **Assessment Details**: Click on "Assessments" to view completed assessment details
- **Status Filtering**: Filter schedule by status type
- **Progress Timeline**: Visual timeline of assessment completion over time
- **Quick Actions**: Direct assessment entry from schedule cards

This integration ensures that therapists have consistent, accurate status information whether they're viewing the patient list or individual patient profiles, with meaningful statistics that track actual therapy progress.
